  <p>
    I’m an image maker who thrives on adapting my work to a variety of
    applications. Everything I do begins with something that is hand-drawn or
    painted…
    <br /><br />
    This has led to projects across editorial, brand storytelling and collaborations,
    installation, publishing, bespoke commissions, and events. I enjoy the collaborative
    process working with a wide spectrum of clients from large brands and companies
    to individuals, from all around the world.
