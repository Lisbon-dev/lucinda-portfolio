A sophisticated editorial series inspired by themes of beauty, wealth, and moral ambiguity. These illustrations capture the glamorous yet hollow world of high society, using refined linework and careful composition to explore the contrast between surface beauty and underlying emptiness.

The series required a delicate balance between attraction and critique, drawing viewers into a world of luxury while questioning its ultimate value.
