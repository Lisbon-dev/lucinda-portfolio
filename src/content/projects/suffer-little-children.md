A provocative editorial series examining the relationship between fame, innocence, and cultural impact. Through carefully rendered celebrity portraits, the work explores how public figures navigate the tension between their private selves and public personas.

Each portrait captures not just physical likeness but the psychological weight of constant scrutiny. The series questions our collective fascination with celebrity while acknowledging the human cost of fame. The layout design balances dramatic imagery with thoughtful editorial content, creating a cohesive narrative across multiple spreads.

This project pushed me to consider the ethical dimensions of portraiture while experimenting with techniques that reveal character beyond surface appearance.
