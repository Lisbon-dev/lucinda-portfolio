An introspective series examining how historical patterns echo through time, rendered in expressive charcoal technique. The portraits capture not just physical likeness but the weight of historical significance, exploring how individual actions ripple through generations.

This project allowed me to experiment with traditional drawing techniques while addressing contemporary themes about learning from the past. The charcoal medium adds gravitas and timelessness to each piece.
