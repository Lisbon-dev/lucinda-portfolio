A contemplative illustration series exploring the psychological landscape of exile and belonging. These images delve into the complex emotions of displacement, whether physical, cultural, or spiritual, creating visual metaphors for the universal human experience of searching for home.

The project challenged me to translate abstract emotional concepts into concrete visual narratives, using symbolism and atmosphere to convey the nuanced experience of feeling like an outsider.
