This editorial illustration series brings the adventurous spirit of classic literature to life through carefully crafted visual narratives. Each spread combines typography and imagery to create an immersive reading experience that captures the raw beauty and danger of the wilderness.

The project challenged me to balance readability with artistic expression, using natural textures and earthy tones to evoke the untamed landscape that forms the backdrop of the story.
