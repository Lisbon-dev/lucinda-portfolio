Inspired by classic film noir, this editorial series captures the psychological tension and atmospheric lighting that defines the genre. Each illustration plays with shadow and light to create mood and narrative depth.

The project required careful attention to composition and contrast, using dramatic chiaroscuro techniques to evoke the suspense and uncertainty central to noir storytelling. The work was featured in a retrospective film festival program celebrating classic cinema.
