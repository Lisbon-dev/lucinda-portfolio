An ambitious 3D illustrative installation created for W Hotel Paris, serving as both an artistic statement and a brand landmark. This large-scale contemporary installation combines digital artistry with physical installation to create an iconic focal point that embodies the hotel's bold, creative spirit.

The installation's design process involved extensive digital modeling and iterative refinement to achieve the perfect balance between artistic expression and spatial functionality. The piece incorporates dynamic forms that interact with the hotel's architecture while maintaining its own distinct artistic identity.

The installation required careful coordination with hotel operations, architectural constraints, and guest experience considerations. The final piece creates an immersive environment that enhances the hotel's contemporary luxury positioning while providing guests with a memorable artistic encounter.

This project demonstrates the successful integration of fine art with commercial hospitality design, creating a piece that functions as both destination art and brand expression. The installation has become a signature element of the W Hotel Paris experience, frequently featured in guest photography and social media.
